The purpose of this project is to create an application that school students can use to practice on their study without any help from particular teacher or coaching center. There will be subjects and chapters aligned. With every chapter has a set of questions. A student is free to practice on any subject or any chapter. Student is also free to practice how many questions they want to practice. He can also determine the time for that particular exam.


We want to build something that gives student freedom on their practice.
